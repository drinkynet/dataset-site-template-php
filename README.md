# dataset-site-template-php
PHP Classes and resources supporting dataset site creation

Tools intended to simplify creation of dataset sites using templates.

For comparison, see the [.NET](https://github.com/openactive/dataset-site-template-example-dotnet) and [Ruby](https://github.com/openactive/dataset-site-template-ruby) implementations.

## Requirements
This project requires PHP >=5.6.
While most of the functionality should work down to PHP 5.4, some functionality (especially around parsing of offset for DateTimeZone) will not work with that version of PHP (see the [DateTimeZone PHP docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetimezone.construct.php#refsect1-datetimezone.construct-changelog) for more info).

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos) is also required for dependency management.

## Development

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openactive/dataset-site-template-php.git
cd dataset-site-template-php
composer install
```

### Running Tests
PHPUnit 4.8 is used to run tests.

To run the whole suite:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

If you want to run the whole suite in verbose mode:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose
```

You can also run a section of the suite by specifying the class's relative path on which you want to perform tests:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose tests/Unit/TemplateRendererTest.php
```

For additional information on the commands available for PHPUnit,
consult [their documentation](https://phpunit.de/manual/4.8/en/installation.html)
